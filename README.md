# Less Darker

Written in JavaScript, compiled with [Electron]([https://www.electronjs.org/](https://github.com/electron/electron)). Less Darker is a simple, free and open-source companion app for [Dark & Darker](https://darkanddarker.com/).

Please help support the hard-working team at [IRONMACE](https://www.ironmace.com/) by buying a copy of their game!

## Features
  ### Client
  
  - Displays your ping to Dark and Darker's servers (currently only supporting USEast - others coming soon!)
    - Check your ping outside the game
    - Minimal packet size to keep your game lag-free

  - Displays if Dark and Darker is detected by our client
    - For peace of mind

  - 'X' to Minimize to tray
    - So that we can be cool like Discord

  ### Overlay
  
  - Ping overlay
    - Basic design for minimal distraction in-game

## System Requirements

- If you can run Dark and Darker, you can probably run this.

- 64-bit Windows 10, 11
  - This is all Dark and Darker currently supports, so we do not plan on adding support for any other platforms.

## Get Started
- Download the installer from our latest [release](https://github.com/less-darker/less-darker/releases) or from our [official website](https://lessdarker.com)
- After installation, Less Darker should automatically launch
- Make sure to pin the program somewhere you will remember, or follow [this easy guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd) to have it launch on startup.
